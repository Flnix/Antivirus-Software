# Comprehensive Antivirus Software Project

---

## Overview

This ambitious project aims to develop a **foundational antivirus software solution** capable of detecting, analyzing, and mitigating various forms of malicious software (malware) on a computer system. Far beyond a simple scanner, this initiative seeks to build a robust framework that simulates key functionalities found in commercial antivirus products. The primary objective is to equip students with a deep understanding of malware analysis, threat detection methodologies, and defensive programming practices.

## Core Concepts & Modules

Students working on this project will delve into and implement the following sophisticated modules and core concepts:

### File System & Process Monitoring Engine

* **Deep Scanning:** Implementing efficient algorithms to traverse entire file systems, including hidden files and system directories.
* **Process Inspection:** Developing capabilities to enumerate running processes, inspect their memory usage, and identify suspicious process behaviors or injected code.
* **System Hooks (Advanced):** Exploring techniques to monitor file creation/modification, process launches, and registry changes (these will be platform-dependent).

### Threat Detection Mechanisms

* **Signature-Based Detection:**
    * **Hash Matching:** Implementing robust hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA256, MD5) to compare file fingerprints against a comprehensive database of known malware hashes.
    * **String/Byte Pattern Matching:** Developing algorithms to search for specific malicious byte sequences or unique strings embedded within files.
    * **Polymorphic and Metamorphic Detection (Basic):** Researching and attempting to implement techniques to identify variants of known malware that change their appearance.
* **Heuristic Analysis:**
    * **Behavioral Heuristics:** Analyzing file or process behavior (e.g., attempts to modify critical system files, unusual network connections, self-replication) to detect suspicious activity without a direct signature.
    * **Static Heuristics:** Examining file characteristics (e.g., unusual section names in executables, high entropy, suspicious API calls) to infer malicious intent.
* **Machine Learning Integration (Advanced):**
    * **Feature Extraction:** Generating meaningful features from files (e.g., opcode sequences, PE header information, string entropy) suitable for AI models.
    * **Classification Models:** Training and deploying machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Neural Networks) to classify files as benign or malicious based on extracted features.
    * **Anomaly Detection:** Utilizing unsupervised learning to identify files or processes that deviate significantly from learned "normal" behavior.

### Quarantine & Remediation Module

* **Secure Quarantining:** Safely moving suspicious files to an isolated, encrypted, and restricted area to prevent further harm.
* **Deletion & Cleanup:** Implementing functionalities to securely delete detected malware and revert system changes made by infections (e.g., registry modifications, host file entries).
* **Restoration:** Providing an option to restore safely quarantined files if they were false positives.

### Reporting & Logging System

* **Detailed Logging:** Comprehensive recording of scan results, detected threats, actions taken, and system events.
* **Reporting:** Generating summary reports of scan activities and security status.
* **Notification System:** Implementing basic alerts for critical detections (e.g., on-screen pop-ups, log file entries).

### User Interface (UI) & Interaction

* **Scan Control:** Providing options for full system scans, custom path scans, and quick scans.
* **Threat Management:** A clear interface to view detected threats, manage quarantined items, and configure scan settings.
* **Status Display:** Real-time feedback on scan progress and system security status.

## Technologies (To be explored, evaluated, and chosen)

Students will have the significant opportunity to research, evaluate, and select the most appropriate technologies for each module. Common categories and examples include:

* **Primary Development Language:** A powerful language with strong system-level capabilities and rich libraries (e.g., Python, C++, Rust, Java, C#).
* **File System & Process Interaction Libraries/APIs:** Operating system-specific interfaces for low-level file system access, process enumeration, and potential system monitoring.
* **Cryptographic Hashing Libraries:** For generating unique identifiers (hashes) of files (e.g., supporting SHA256, MD5, etc.).
* **Pattern Matching & String Manipulation Libraries:** For efficient searching of byte sequences within files.
* **Machine Learning Frameworks:** For building and deploying AI models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).   --OPTIONAL
* **Data Storage:** For managing signature databases and logs (e.g., SQLite for local storage, plain text files).
* **User Interface Frameworks:** For developing desktop applications (e.g., Qt, GTK, WPF, Tkinter).   --OPTIONAL
